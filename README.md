# A Stable Self-Organized Vortex Rose Spontaneously Out Of The Turbulence

Many repeating copies of a sample from the [1989 PBS Nova TV program "Strange New Science of Chaos"](https://youtu.be/eJAs9Qr359o?t=53m20s) gradually go out of phase with each other, resulting in humorous robot music in the style of early Steve Reich phasing tape music.

To generate the music:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./go.py
```
